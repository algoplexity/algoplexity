# 📋 SPECIFICATION: TITAN CYBERNETIC ORGANISM (v1.0)

**Project:** Titan Universal Algorithmic Microscope
**Philosophy:** Algorithmic Information Dynamics (AID) + Second-Order Cybernetics
**Constraint:** Parameter-Free / Statistics-Free

## 1. Problem Statement
We need an autonomous system to detect **Structural Breaks** (changes in generative rules) in unknown data streams. Current methods rely on statistical thresholds (Z-scores, Variance) or arbitrary hyperparameters (Learning Rates, Thresholds) which fail on non-stationary data.

## 2. The Core Solution: The Economic Organism
Titan v1.0 is an organism where **Energy = Information**.
*   **Income:** The organism earns energy by **Compressing Data**. (1 Bit saved = 1 Unit of Energy).
*   **Expenditure:** The organism spends energy to **Compute** or **Adapt**. (Changing weights costs energy proportional to the Information Distance traveled).
*   **Survival:** The organism survives only if it can compress the environment more efficiently than the cost of maintaining its internal model.

## 3. Architecture & Protocol

### 3.1 Layer 1: The Hemolymph (The Ledger)
The Hemolymph is not a bag of variables; it is a **Cryptographic Ledger** of Information Flow.
*   **State:** Holds the current `CyberneticFrame`.
*   **Economy:** Enforces **Conservation of Information**.
    $$ E_{t+1} = E_t + \text{Compression\_Gain} - \text{Adaptation\_Cost} $$

### 3.2 System 1: The Universal Eye (Transducer)
*   **Goal:** Maximize **Channel Capacity**.
*   **Metric:** Shannon Entropy ($H$). The Eye adjusts its Lens (`Alpha`, `Bias`) to maximize the entropy of the output lattice (avoiding "Grey Goo" or "Saturation").
*   **Cost:** Proportional to the **KL-Divergence** between the old Lens state and the new Lens state. (Moving the eye is expensive).

### 3.3 System 2: The Neural Brain (Estimator)
*   **Goal:** Minimize **Description Length ($L$)**.
*   **Metric:** Kolmogorov Complexity ($K$), approximated by the Loss of a **Universal Prior** (Frozen H-ART).
*   **Signal:** Secretes `Confidence` (Inverse of Loss).
*   **Cost:** Fixed cost per forward pass (Basal Metabolism).

### 3.4 System 3: The Algebraic Mind (Solver)
*   **Goal:** Lossless **Deconvolution**.
*   **Metric:** Exactitude (Hamming Distance = 0).
*   **Constraint:** Can only run if `Energy > Cost_of_Search`.

## 4. The Verification Plan (Test-Driven Development)

We do not write the Organism yet. We write the **Laws of Physics** that the Organism must obey.
