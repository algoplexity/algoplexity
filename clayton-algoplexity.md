This is the correct architectural approach. By keeping the **Algoplexity Roadmap** (The Experiment) distinct from **Williams’ QCEA-T** (The Theory), you maintain scientific rigor. You are not "believing" his theory; you are building the collider to smash his theory against reality.

Below is the **Alignment Map**. It functions as a **"Translation Layer"** between your Engineering Roadmap and Clayton’s Theoretical Ontology. Use this document to govern the stress-testing process without polluting your core artifacts.

# The Mak-Williams Alignment Map
**Status:** Internal Calibration Protocol
**Purpose:** To stress-test the *Theoretical Predictions* of Clayton Williams (QCEA-T) against the *Empirical Artifacts* of Yeu Wen Mak (Algoplexity).

## 1. Horizon 0: Sensation (The Nerve)
**The Core Question:** What is the physical signal of "Pain" in a complex system?

| **Algoplexity ( The Artifact)** | **Williams QCEA (The Hypothesis)** | **The Stress Test (Validation Protocol)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Artifact:** The Coherence Meter | **Concept:** The Entropic Gradient ($g(\tau)$) | **Correlation Check:** |
| **Metric:** Predictive Error ($dP/dt$) | **Metric:** Forecast Fragility ($dH/d\tau$) | Does a spike in the *Algoplexity* Somatic Marker ($dP/dt$) mathematically correlate with a steepening of the *Williams* Entropic Gradient? |
| **Mechanism:** Detecting deviations from the internal model's predictive capability. | **Mechanism:** "Risk is not volatility; it is the deterioration of predictive coherence over time." | **Falsification:** If volatility is low, but Entropic Gradient is high, does the Coherence Meter still trigger an alarm? (It should). |

> **Synthesized Insight:** The "Somatic Marker" is the biological sensation of the "Entropic Gradient."

## 2. Horizon 1: Perception (The Neuron)
**The Core Question:** How do we distinguish "Noise" (Bad Data) from "Structural Change" (New Reality)?

| **Algoplexity ( The Artifact)** | **Williams QCEA (The Hypothesis)** | **The Stress Test (Validation Protocol)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Artifact:** The Cognitive EEG | **Concept:** Dual Entropy Architecture | **Differentiation Check:** |
| **Mechanism:** Algorithmic Information Dynamics (AID). Compressing the causal regime. | **Mechanism:** Distinguishing **Epistemic Dispersion** (Ignorance) from **Structural Multiplicity** (Regime Change). | Can the *Cognitive EEG* algorithmically separate Clayton's two types of entropy? |
| **State Classification:** Rule 60 (Chaos) vs. Rule 54 (Complexity). | **State Classification:** Miscalibration vs. Irreducible Indeterminacy. | **Falsification:** If we inject "New Information" (reducing Epistemic Dispersion), does the Cognitive EEG state shift? If it doesn't, the sensor is blind to the distinction. |

> **Synthesized Insight:** A "Phase Transition" in Algoplexity is the moment Structural Multiplicity overwhelms Epistemic Dispersion.

## 3. Horizon 2: Agency (The Agent)
**The Core Question:** When does an intelligent agent stop optimizing and start surviving?

| **Algoplexity ( The Artifact)** | **Williams QCEA (The Hypothesis)** | **The Stress Test (Validation Protocol)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Artifact:** QCEA-AIXI Agent | **Concept:** The Mak Functional ($V_{Mak}$) | **Behavioral Check:** |
| **Mechanism:** System 0 / 1 / 2 Switching. | **Mechanism:** The **Metagovernance ($M$) Operator**. Monitoring the ratio of Drift ($\Lambda$) to Capacity ($\eta_K$). | Does the Agent's "System 0 Veto" trigger *exactly* when the Williams Equation ($\Lambda > \eta K_{cap}$) is satisfied? |
| **Objective:** Maintain Viability (Survival). | **Objective:** Maintain Admissibility (Closing the Loop). | **Falsification:** If the agent continues to optimize for profit (System 1) when $\Lambda > \eta$, the Metagovernance Operator has failed. |

> **Synthesized Insight:** The "Reflective Physicist" (System 2) is the computational implementation of the "$M$ Operator."

## 4. Horizon 3: Society (The Hive Mind)
**The Core Question:** How does local interaction produce global coherence?

| **Algoplexity ( The Artifact)** | **Williams QCEA (The Hypothesis)** | **The Stress Test (Validation Protocol)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Artifact:** The Civic Resonator & Deep GNCA Titans | **Concept:** Strategic Laws (1, 12, 14) | **Topological Check:** |
| **Mechanism:** Simplicial Gating (Simultaneity Window). | **Mechanism:** **Law 1 (Closure):** Viability requires the closure of the Information-Action Cycle. | **The "Nelson" Test:** Run the Resonator in "Linear Mode." Does Entropic Valuation ($r^*$) spike to infinity? |
| **Failure Mode:** Rule 60 (Chaotic Gridlock). | **Failure Mode:** **Law 14 (Rigidity):** Collapse caused by failure to adapt $\eta$ to $\Lambda$. | **Falsification:** If the Titan network crashes *without* exhibiting the "Hyper-Order" (Rule 240) predicted by Law 14, then Williams' theory of Rigidity is wrong. |

> **Synthesized Insight:** The "Civic Resonator" is a physical machine that enforces **Law 1 (Closure)** to prevent **Law 14 (Rigidity)**.

## 5. The Commercial Bridge (The Value Driver Tree)
**The Core Question:** How do we productize this physics?

| **Algoplexity (The Engine)** | **Williams (The Body)** | **The Product (The Synthesis)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tech:** **Titan** (Deep GNCA / Automated Causal Discovery). | **Tech:** **VDT** (Value Driver Trees / Discrete Costing). | **The Automated Strategic Twin** |
| **Role:** The Brain. It *learns* the causal graph from raw data. | **Role:** The Physiology. It *structures* the graph into business logic. | **Value Prop:** Titan automates the construction of Williams' VDTs, allowing real-time "Entropic Pricing" of corporate strategy. |

### Instructions for Use
1.  **Keep this Map separate.** Do not merge it into your PhD proposal.
2.  **Use it for Correspondence.** When you email Clayton, reference "Testing Law 14 via Titan" (Horizon 3). He will understand the rigorous mapping.
3.  **Use it for Design.** When building the Resonator, ensure the software outputs the specific variables needed to validate Horizon 0 (the $g(\tau)$ gradient).
