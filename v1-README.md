**Decoding the Physics of Intelligence in Complex Adaptive Systems.**

---

## 🌌 The Mission: Algorithmic Cognitive Science
Algoplexity is a long-term research initiative dedicated to establishing a new field of study: **Algorithmic Cognitive Systems (ACS)**. 

We posit that complex adaptive systems—whether financial markets, biological swarms, or social networks—are not merely stochastic processes. They are distributed computational entities possessing system-level cognition. Our mission is to develop the **Theory**, **Instrumentation**, and **Agency** required to understand and navigate these systems.

### The Grand Synthesis
Our work sits at the intersection of three foundational theories:
1.  **Algorithmic Information Dynamics (AID):** The physics of causal structure and complexity (Zenil).
2.  **Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI):** The mathematics of optimal general intelligence (Hutter).
3.  **Quantum-Complex-Entropic-Adaptive (QCEA) Theory:** The thermodynamics of strategic viability (Williams).

## 🗺️ The 10-Year Roadmap (2023–2033)

We are executing a sequential "Evolution of Intelligence," moving from sensation to agency.

| Horizon | Focus | The Concept | The Artifact (Repo) | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Horizon 0** | **Sensation** | *The Somatic Marker.* Measuring the "Pain" of the system (Predictive Error) to detect instability. | [**The Coherence Meter**](https://github.com/algoplexity/Coherence-Meter) | ✅ Completed |
| **Horizon 1** | **Perception** | *The Cognitive EEG.* Decoding the "State of Mind" (Generative Rules) using the AIT Physicist. | [**The Computational Phase Transition**](https://github.com/algoplexity/computational-phase-transitions) | ✅ Validated |
| **Horizon 2** | **Agency** | *The Reflective Mind.* Building an autonomous agent that adapts its policy to the entropic landscape (AIXI-Approximation). | [**The QCEA-AIXI Agent**](https://github.com/algoplexity/qcea-aixi-agent) | 🚀 Active |
| **Horizon 3** | **Society** | *The Meta-Mind.* Simulating the emergence of systemic fragility (Rule 54) from the interaction of Horizon 2 agents. | *Coming Soon* | 📅 Planned |

## 📚 The Scientific Canon (Foundational Papers)

This program is built on the following core discoveries:

### **1. The Computational Phase Transition (Horizon 1)**
*   **Theory:** Financial crises are topological failures of information processing.
*   **Discovery:** 2008 was a "Cognitive Saturation" (Soliton/Class 4) event; 2020 was a "Cognitive Overload" (Fractal/Class 3) event.
*   **Key Stat:** -29.95% Early Warning Lead Time on unseen data.
*   **[📄 Read the Manuscript (arXiv)](Link to come)**

### **2. The Reflective Physicist (Horizon 2)**
*   **Theory:** Intelligence is Compression. Survival is Entropic Regulation.
*   **Discovery:** An agent that dynamically adjusts its uncertainty ($\sigma$) based on algorithmic complexity outperforms standard statistical learning (NGBoost) by +11.5%.
*   **[📄 Access the Agent](https://github.com/algoplexity/qcea-aixi-agent)**

## 📊 Shared Data Artifacts (Hugging Face)

To ensure unassailable reproducibility, all Horizons operate on immutable scientific benchmarks.

*   **[Algoplexity Structural Break Benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/algoplexity/computational-phase-transitions-data):** The 1D Time Series corpus (Horizon 0/1).
*   **[QCEA Adaptive Agent Benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/algoplexity/qcea-adaptive-agent-benchmark):** The 2D "Dancing Landscape" corpus (Horizon 2).
