# RDMP — MACYB Master v4
## Repeatable Development, Metadata, and Knowledge Base Protocol

**Owner:** algoplexity  
**Scope:**  
- `algoplexity/algoplexity`
- `algoplexity/ANU-MACYB-private`
- `algoplexity/ANU-MACYB-public`
- Zotero
- Drive
- AI coding assistants

**Purpose:**  
This protocol defines how MACYB operates as a **repeatable, iterative, LLM-assisted knowledge system** spanning theory, implementation, publication, and archival recordkeeping.

---

# 0. Core principle

MACYB is a three-layer system:

- **A_Theory** — canonical concepts and formal theory
- **B_Computation** — private implementation and working knowledge base
- **C_Measurement_CIO** — public-safe curated mirror and communication layer

The system improves through repeated cycles of:
- ingesting sources,
- compiling knowledge,
- implementing theory,
- producing outputs,
- linting and repairing,
- publishing safe subsets,
- and preserving provenance.

---

# 1. Systems of record

## 1.1 Zotero
Authoritative for:
- references
- metadata
- source notes
- PDFs / URLs
- literature organization
- provenance anchors

## 1.2 `ANU-MACYB-private`
Authoritative for:
- working markdown drafts
- private implementation
- internal architecture
- LLM-maintained compiled knowledge
- project notes
- decision logs
- pre-publication staging

## 1.3 Drive
Authoritative for:
- final submitted PDFs / Docs
- feedback files
- large or binary artefacts
- archived deliverables
- authoritative final snapshots

## 1.4 `ANU-MACYB-public`
Authoritative for:
- sanitized public documentation
- curated summaries
- public Pages content
- safe demonstrations
- shareable knowledge outputs

---

# 2. Repo roles

## 2.1 `algoplexity/algoplexity` — Theory source
Defines:
- foundational concepts
- formal theory
- research framing
- canonical terminology
- theory revisions
- slices of CI-Unified theory

## 2.2 `ANU-MACYB-private` — Working implementation and knowledge engine
Contains:
- implementation of selected theory slices
- working docs and code
- LLM-maintained compiled knowledge
- internal design notes
- simulation and experimentation
- decisions and provenance

## 2.3 `ANU-MACYB-public` — Curated public mirror
Contains:
- sanitized summaries
- public-facing docs
- Pages site content
- stable explanation of the selected theory slice
- public-safe demos and examples

---

# 3. Canonical source hierarchy

When content conflicts, use this order:

1. Direct user instruction
2. Repository reality
3. `algoplexity/algoplexity` theory
4. `ANU-MACYB-private` implementation
5. `ANU-MACYB-public` publication
6. Drive final deliverables

If theory changes, downstream implementation and public layers must be reviewed.  
If private implementation changes, public mirror must be reviewed.  
If public wording changes, it must be checked against private and theory sources.

---

# 4. Zotero metadata protocol

## 4.1 Zotero is mandatory
All external sources and major conceptual influences should be tracked in Zotero.

## 4.2 Collections
Suggested collections:
- MACYB
  - Theory
  - CPS1-individual
  - CPS2-group
  - Methods
  - Public-writing
  - Background reading

## 4.3 Required fields
For each item:
- Title
- Author(s)
- Year
- Source type
- DOI / URL
- Tags
- Relevance note
- Linked repo/doc
- Related theory or implementation slice

## 4.4 Citation rule
If a repo artefact depends on a source:
- capture it in Zotero
- reference it in the artefact
- keep the note traceable to the source

---

# 5. Knowledge base operating model

MACYB is also a living knowledge base maintained by LLMs.

## 5.1 Knowledge layers
Use these logical layers:

- **raw/** — source capture
- **compiled/** — LLM-structured wiki
- **derived/** — outputs and syntheses
- **validated/** — linted and repaired artefacts
- **public/** — sanitized mirror
- **archive/** — historical artefacts

## 5.2 Ingestion
Sources may include:
- papers
- articles
- repos
- datasets
- images
- clips
- notes
- transcripts

All should be captured with provenance.

## 5.3 Compilation
The LLM should:
- summarize sources
- create concept pages
- build backlinks
- maintain indices
- extract relationships
- note uncertainty
- propose new article candidates

## 5.4 Query loop
When asked a question, the LLM should:
1. inspect compiled knowledge
2. consult raw sources if needed
3. synthesize an answer
4. generate reusable output if useful
5. file the output back into the knowledge base

## 5.5 Output filing
Outputs such as memos, slides, diagrams, charts, and tables should be filed back into the knowledge system unless strictly ephemeral.

## 5.6 Linting
The LLM should periodically check for:
- inconsistent data
- duplicate pages
- missing metadata
- stale concepts
- orphaned pages
- drift in terminology
- contradiction between theory and implementation

---

# 6. Change propagation rules

## 6.1 Theory → Private
If theory changes:
- update dependent private docs
- review implementation terminology
- update provenance blocks
- mark public content for review

## 6.2 Private → Public
If private implementation changes:
- sanitize the public mirror
- remove unstable/private detail
- preserve conceptual alignment
- update public docs only if safe

## 6.3 Public → Review
If public content changes:
- verify it matches private source
- verify it matches theory source
- verify it adds no new meaning

---

# 7. Iteration protocol

## 7.1 Theory revision
Occurs when a definition, formalism, scope boundary, or concept name changes.

Required:
- update private implementation docs
- update Zotero notes if relevant
- update public mirror if affected

## 7.2 Implementation revision
Occurs when code, metrics, pipeline stages, or architecture changes.

Required:
- record in decision log
- link to upstream theory
- update public-safe materials if necessary

## 7.3 Publication revision
Occurs when a stable private artifact is sanitized for public release.

Required:
- verify safety
- verify traceability
- preserve conceptual fidelity
- avoid leaking private work

---

# 8. Traceability and provenance

Every major artefact should record:
- source theory
- implementation source
- public mirror target
- Zotero items
- sync status
- last reviewed date
- divergence notes

## Suggested metadata block
```markdown
## Metadata
- Source theory: algoplexity/algoplexity
- Implementation source: ANU-MACYB-private/projects/cps1-individual/...
- Public mirror: ANU-MACYB-public/projects/cps1-individual/...
- Zotero collection: MACYB / Theory
- Upstream source(s): ...
- Sync status: aligned | partial | diverged
- Last reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
- Notes: ...
```

---

# 9. Terminology governance

## Canonical terms
These should be treated carefully:
- theory names
- metric names
- architecture layer names
- repo role names
- system-of-record labels

## Allowed drift
- explanatory prose
- public narrative wording
- local experimental labels
- implementation shorthand

## Frozen terms
If a cross-repo term changes:
- theory must be reviewed
- implementation must be reviewed
- public wording must be reviewed

---

# 10. Divergence handling

Divergence is allowed only when intentional.

## Examples
- implementation simplification
- staged publication lag
- public-safe omission
- experimental terminology

## Required response
If divergence exists:
- record why
- record whether temporary or permanent
- identify affected repos/files
- mark sync status

---

# 11. Folder expectations

## 11.1 `ANU-MACYB-private`
- working drafts
- internal architecture
- decision logs
- metadata manifests
- compiled knowledge
- outputs staged for review

## 11.2 `ANU-MACYB-public`
- curated docs
- blog posts
- Pages content
- safe examples
- stable public knowledge

## 11.3 Drive
- authoritative final files
- large artefacts
- submission exports
- feedback files

## 11.4 Zotero
- bibliographic metadata
- notes
- source links
- PDFs / attachments

---

# 12. Publication gate

Before publishing anything public:
- no secrets
- no sensitive reflections
- no restricted course submissions
- no copyrighted redistribution
- no private-only design detail
- no unstable theory claims

---

# 13. AI-assisted development governance

AI coding assistants may be used, but outputs must:
- follow repo architecture
- preserve provenance
- be reviewed before commit
- avoid secrets and restricted data
- not bypass Zotero/reference capture
- not introduce unreviewed theory claims

---

# 14. Operating loop

The system should run as a repeating cycle:

1. ingest raw sources
2. capture metadata in Zotero
3. compile sources into markdown knowledge
4. update theory or implementation as needed
5. generate outputs
6. file outputs back into the knowledge base
7. lint and repair
8. publish sanitized mirrors
9. archive old artefacts
10. repeat

---

# 15. Actionable CPS project folder structure

Use the following structure for the CPS project so the RDMP is immediately actionable.
