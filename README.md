**Decoding the Physics of Intelligence in Complex Adaptive Systems.**

## 🌌 The Mission: Algorithmic Cognitive Science (ACS)
Algoplexity is a long-term research initiative dedicated to establishing a new field of study: **Algorithmic Cognitive Systems**.

We posit that complex adaptive systems—whether **financial markets**, biological swarms, or social institutions—are not merely stochastic processes. They are **Distributed Computational Entities** possessing system-level cognition. Our mission is to develop the **Theory**, **Instrumentation**, and **Agency** required to navigate the "Dancing Landscape" of these systems.

### The Grand Synthesis
Our work unifies five foundational theories into a coherent engineering framework:
1.  **Algorithmic Information Dynamics (AID):** The physics of causal structure and complexity (Zenil).
2.  **Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI):** The mathematics of optimal general intelligence (Hutter).
3.  **Quantum-Complex-Entropic-Adaptive (QCEA) Theory:** The thermodynamics of strategic viability (Williams).
4.  **Entropic Valuation:** The reconstruction of value based on **Epistemic Fragility** ($dH/d\tau$) rather than temporal decay (Williams).
5.  **Graph Neural Cellular Automata (GNCA):** The topology of distributed computation (Grattarola).

## 🗺️ The 10-Year Roadmap (2023–2033)

We are executing a **"Reduction-Synthesis"** cycle: zooming in to solve the atomic unit of cognition (The Agent), then zooming out to model the distributed network (The Market/Society).

| Horizon | Focus | Cognitive Scale | Dimensionality | The Scientific Goal | Artifact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Foundation** | Ontology | **The Swarm** | **N-D (Matrix)** | *The Existence Proof.* Genetic Algorithms prove that market cross-sections are algorithmic, not random. | [**Master's Thesis**](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.22740.46722) |

| **Horizon 2** | Agency | **The Agent** | **Cybernetic** | *The Reflective Mind.* An autonomous agent that adapts its policy to the entropic landscape (AIXI-Approx). | [**The QCEA-AIXI Agent**](https://github.com/algoplexity/qcea-aixi-agent) |
| **Horizon 3** | Networks | **The Hive Mind** | **N-D (Graph)** | *The Collective Intelligence.* Modeling systemic risk in **Financial Markets** and **Social Systems** via Graph Neural Cellular Automata (GNCA). | *Planning* |

## 📚 The Scientific Canon

### **Foundation: The Existence Proof (2023)**
*   **Discovery:** Financial markets contain discoverable algorithmic structures (Rule 131, Pair 35/115) invisible to standard econometrics.
*   **Method:** Genetic Algorithms (Search) + MILS Encoding.
*   **Legacy:** Established the **Ontology** (Markets are Computers) but lacked Real-Time Diagnosis.

### **Horizon 0: The Somatic Marker (2025a)**
*   **Discovery:** **"Less is More."** High-resolution statistical multivariate models (VAR) fail to detect breaks due to parameter explosion. A simple univariate proxy (Predictive Error) works better.
*   **Method:** Logistic Regression + MDL.
*   **Legacy:** Established the **Architecture** (Simple Detector + Sophisticated Signal).

### **Horizon 1: The Cognitive EEG (2025b)**
*   **Discovery:** **Taxonomy of Cognitive Failure.**
    *   **2008:** Cognitive Saturation (Rule 54 / Colliding Solitons).
    *   **2020:** Cognitive Overload (Rule 60 / Fractal Shattering).
*   **Method:** The **AIT Physicist** (Transformer) trained on the Wolfram Computational Universe.
*   **Validation:** Achieved **-29.95%** early-warning lead time on unseen out-of-sample data.

### **Horizon 2: The Reflective Physicist (Current)**
*   **Discovery:** **Entropic Valuation & Plasticity.** An agent that adjusts its "Wingspan" (Uncertainty) based on the Physicist's diagnosis outperforms statistical baselines by **+11.5%**.
*   **Method:** **QCEA-AIXI Agent**. A cybernetic loop utilizing **Entropic Valuation** to price risk based on epistemic fragility rather than time.
*   **Goal:** Solve the **Control Problem** via Zero-Shot Adaptation.

### **Horizon 3: The Graph-Theoretic Future**
*   **Hypothesis:** Systemic Risk is a **Graph Cellular Automaton**.
*   **Goal:** Return to the multivariate domain (from the Thesis) equipped with the tools of Horizon 1 & 2.
*   **Method:** **Graph Neural Cellular Automata (GNCA)**.
    *   **In Finance:** Modeling the percolation of Rule 54 (Cognitive Rigidity) across **Asset Correlation Networks** to predict liquidity freezes.
    *   **In Society:** Modeling the propagation of information shocks across **Institutional Networks** to predict governance failure.

## 📊 Shared Data Artifacts (Hugging Face)

To ensure unassailable reproducibility, all Horizons operate on immutable scientific benchmarks.

*   **[Algoplexity Structural Break Benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/algoplexity/computational-phase-transitions-data):** The 1D Time Series corpus (Horizon 0/1).
*   **[QCEA Adaptive Agent Benchmark](https://huggingface.co/datasets/algoplexity/qcea-adaptive-agent-benchmark):** The 2D "Dancing Landscape" corpus (Horizon 2).
