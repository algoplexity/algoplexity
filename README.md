**Decoding the Physics of Intelligence in Complex Adaptive Systems.**

## 🌌 The Mission: Algorithmic Cognitive Science (ACS)
Algoplexity is a long-term research initiative dedicated to establishing a new field of study: **Algorithmic Cognitive Systems**.

We posit that complex adaptive systems—whether **financial markets**, biological swarms, or social institutions—are not merely stochastic processes. They are **Distributed Computational Entities** possessing system-level cognition. Our mission is to develop the **Theory**, **Instrumentation**, and **Agency** required to understand and navigate the "Dancing Landscape" of these systems.

### The Grand Synthesis
Our work unifies five foundational theories into a coherent engineering framework:
1.  **Algorithmic Information Dynamics (AID):** The physics of causal structure and complexity (Zenil).
2.  **Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI):** The mathematics of optimal general intelligence (Hutter).
3.  **Quantum-Complex-Entropic-Adaptive (QCEA) Theory:** The thermodynamics of strategic viability (Williams).
4.  **Entropic Valuation:** The reconstruction of value based on **Epistemic Fragility** ($dH/d\tau$) rather than temporal decay (Williams).
5.  **Graph Neural Cellular Automata (GNCA):** The topology of distributed computation (Grattarola).

## 🗺️ The 10-Year Roadmap (2023–2033)

We are executing a **"Reduction-Synthesis"** cycle: zooming in from the macro-swarm to the atomic unit of cognition (The Agent) to solve the problem of Perception, before zooming out to model the distributed network (The Society).

## 📚 The Scientific Canon

### **Foundation: The Existence Proof (2023)**
*   **Discovery:** Financial markets contain discoverable algorithmic structures (Rule 131, Pair 35/115) that are invisible to standard econometrics.
*   **Method:** Genetic Algorithms (Search) + MILS Encoding.
*   **Legacy:** Established the **Ontology** (Markets are Computers) but lacked Real-Time Diagnosis.
*   **Artifact:** [**Discovering Hidden Structures in Stock Market Data**](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.22740.46722) (DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.22740.46722).

### **Horizon 0: The Somatic Marker (2025a)**
*   **Discovery:** **"Less is More."** High-resolution statistical multivariate models (VAR) fail to detect breaks due to parameter explosion. A simple univariate proxy (Predictive Error) works better.
*   **Method:** Logistic Regression + MDL.
*   **Legacy:** Established the **Architecture** (Simple Detector + Sophisticated Signal).
*   **Artifact:** [**SSRN Working Paper**](https://ssrn.com/abstract=5914102), [**ResearchGate**](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.35243.09767) (DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.35243.09767)
 
### **Horizon 1: The Cognitive EEG (2025b)**
*   **Discovery:** **Taxonomy of Cognitive Failure.**
    *   **2008:** **Cognitive Saturation** (Rule 54 / Colliding Solitons). The market "thinks itself into a corner."
    *   **2020:** **Cognitive Overload** (Rule 60 / Fractal Shattering). The shock outruns the mixing time.
*   **Method:** The **AIT Physicist** (Transformer) trained on the Wolfram Computational Universe.
*   **Validation:** Achieved **-29.95%** early-warning lead time on unseen out-of-sample data (The Generalization Inversion).

### **Horizon 2: The Reflective Physicist (Current)**
*   **Discovery:** **Entropic Valuation & Plasticity.** An agent that adjusts its "Wingspan" (Uncertainty) based on the Physicist's diagnosis outperforms statistical baselines by **+11.5%**.
*   **Method:** **QCEA-AIXI Agent**. A cybernetic loop utilizing **Entropic Valuation** to price risk based on epistemic fragility rather than time.
*   **Goal:** Solve the **Control Problem** via Zero-Shot Adaptation.

### **Horizon 3: The Graph-Theoretic Future**
*   **Hypothesis:** Systemic Risk is a **Graph Neural Cellular Automaton (GNCA)**. A market crash is the propagation of a specific computational state (Rule 54/Default) across the asset topology.
*   **The Challenge:** As identified in our review of **Burtsev [2024]** and **Grattarola [2021]**, standard GNCAs excel at instantaneous local updates but struggle with **Long-Horizon Planning** in complex regimes. Due to the **$\ell$-hop receptive field limit**, they often fail to predict the long-range propagation of "Soliton" structures (Rule 54) over extended timeframes.
*   **The Scientific Goal:** To engineer a **Deep GNCA** capable of robust long-term simulation. We will move beyond simple "Next-Step Prediction" to **"Trajectory Optimization,"** incorporating multi-step horizons into the loss function to capture the full lifecycle of a systemic crisis.

#### **Application A (Markets / UCL): Modeling Algorithmic Monoculture**
*   **The Theory:** Market stability relies on strategy diversity. When AI agents converge on identical strategies, the system becomes rigid.
*   **The Simulation:** We will use GNCA to model this **Strategy Convergence**. By simulating the network over long time horizons, we aim to prove that "Flash Crashes" are the inevitable mathematical result of homogenized decision rules in a connected graph.

#### **Application B (Institutions / ANU): Cybernetic Governance**
*   **The Theory:** Leadership is the stewardship of system topology.
*   **The Tool:** A **Systemic Dashboard**. Using the GNCA to visualize how "Cognitive Saturation" (information overload) spreads through an organization's communication network, allowing leaders to intervene before the graph loses coherence.

#### **Application C (Economy / INET Oxford): Complexity Economics**
*   **The Theory:** The economy is a non-equilibrium system of interacting automata.
*   **The Model:** Modeling supply chains not as input-output matrices, but as **Evolving Computation**. We track how shocks (Rule 60) propagate through the global trade network, testing which topologies are robust to "Fractal Shattering."
