**Decoding the Physics of Intelligence in Complex Adaptive Systems.**

---

## 🌌 The Mission: Algorithmic Cognitive Science (ACS)
Algoplexity is a long-term research initiative dedicated to establishing a new field of study: **Algorithmic Cognitive Systems**.

We posit that complex adaptive systems—whether **financial markets**, biological swarms, or social institutions—are not merely stochastic processes. They are **Distributed Computational Entities** possessing system-level cognition. Our mission is to develop the **Theory**, **Instrumentation**, and **Agency** required to understand and navigate the "Dancing Landscape" of these systems.

### The Grand Synthesis
Our work unifies seven foundational theories into a coherent engineering framework:
1.  **Algorithmic Information Dynamics (AID):** The physics of causal structure and complexity (Zenil).
2.  **Universal Artificial Intelligence (UAI):** The mathematics of optimal general intelligence (Hutter).
3.  **Nested Learning Theory (NL):** The mechanics of hierarchical optimization and continuum memory (Behrouz).
4.  **Quantum-Complex-Entropic-Adaptive (QCEA) Theory:** The thermodynamics of strategic viability (Williams).
5.  **Entropic Valuation:** The reconstruction of value based on **Epistemic Fragility** ($dH/d\tau$) rather than temporal decay.
6.  **Coherence Theory ($\Lambda / \eta_K$):** The rigorous condition for eco-evolutionary stability (Williams). We define regime collapse as a deterministic threshold where Environmental Drift ($\Lambda$) exceeds the Hereditary Update Rate ($\eta_K$).
7.  **Graph Neural Cellular Automata (GNCA):** The topology of distributed computation (Grattarola).

## 🗺️ The 10-Year Roadmap (2023–2033)

We are executing a **"Reduction-Synthesis"** cycle: zooming in from the macro-swarm to the atomic unit of cognition (The Agent) to solve the problem of Perception, before zooming out to model the distributed network (The Society).

## 📚 The Scientific Canon

### **Foundation: The Existence Proof (2023)**
*   **Discovery:** Financial markets contain discoverable algorithmic structures (Rule 131, Pair 35/115) that are invisible to standard econometrics.
*   **Method:** Genetic Algorithms (Search) + MILS Encoding.
*   **Legacy:** Established the **Ontology** (Markets are Computers) but lacked Real-Time Diagnosis.
*   **Artifact:** [**Discovering Hidden Structures in Stock Market Data**](https://doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.22740.46722).

### **Horizon 0: The Somatic Marker (2025a)**
*   **Discovery:** **"Less is More."** High-resolution statistical multivariate models (VAR) fail to detect breaks due to parameter explosion. A simple univariate proxy (Predictive Error) works better.
*   **The Physics:** Identified the **"Pain"** signal necessary for the inner-loop optimizer, marking the point where the environment outpaces the model ($\Lambda > \eta_K$).
*   **Artifact:** [**SSRN Working Paper**](https://ssrn.com/abstract=5914102)
 
### **Horizon 1: The Cognitive EEG (2025b)**
*   **Discovery:** **Taxonomy of Cognitive Failure.**
    *   **Cognitive Saturation** (Rule 54 / Colliding Solitons): The market "thinks itself into a corner."
    *   **Cognitive Overload** (Rule 60 / Fractal Shattering): The shock outruns the mixing time.
*   **The NL Perspective:** Engineered the **Slow Context Flow**. The AIT Physicist compresses the long-term computational regime into a tractable state vector, acting as a "Lyapunov Meter" for the system.
*   **Validation:** Achieved **-29.95%** early-warning lead time on unseen out-of-sample data.

### **Horizon 2: The Reflective Physicist (Current)**
*   **Discovery:** **Entropic Valuation & Plasticity.** An agent that adjusts its "Wingspan" (Uncertainty) based on the Physicist's diagnosis outperforms statistical baselines by **+11.5%**.
*   **The Physics:** Solves the **Frequency Gap**. We define viability as the ratio between market bandwidth ($\Lambda$) and agent plasticity ($\eta_K$).
    *   **System 0 (Coherence Veto):** Hard-coded survival prior when $\Lambda \gg \eta_K$ (Cold Start/Crash).
    *   **System 2 (Nested Optimizer):** Adapts policy when $\Lambda \approx \eta_K$ (Tracking).
*   **Method:** **QCEA-AIXI Agent**. A cybernetic loop utilizing **Entropic Valuation** to trigger zero-shot policy shifts.

### **Horizon 3: The Graph-Theoretic Future**
*   **Hypothesis:** Systemic Risk is a **Graph Neural Cellular Automata (GNCA)**. A market crash is the propagation of a specific computational state (Rule 54/Default) across the asset topology.
*   **The Scientific Goal:** To engineer **Deep GNCA Titans** [Behrouz et al., 2025]—graph nodes that are self-referential learners. We will simulate how "Flash Crashes" emerge when these self-modifying agents synchronize their internal optimization logic, causing **Global Coherence Loss**.
*   **The Architectural Trinity:**
    1.  **r-GCA (Relation-Based Neighborhoods):** Moving beyond physical adjacency to model influence across abstract financial topologies [Grattarola et al.].
    2.  **E(n)-Equivariance:** Ensuring the model learns isotropic rules that hold regardless of the specific asset permutation [Gala et al.].
    3.  **DiffLogic (Differentiable Logic):** Utilizing differentiable logic gates (AND/OR/XOR) to extract human-readable boolean rules for governance [Miotti et al.].

#### **Application A (Markets / UCL): Modeling Algorithmic Monoculture**
*   **The Theory:** Market stability relies on **Cognitive Diversity**. When AI agents converge on identical strategies (or identical *Update Rules* per NL theory), the system becomes rigid ($\eta_{Hive} \to 0$).
*   **The Simulation:** We will use GNCA to model this **Strategy Convergence**. By simulating the network over long time horizons, we aim to prove that "Flash Crashes" are the inevitable mathematical result of homogenized decision rules in a connected graph.

#### **Application B (Institutions / ANU): Cybernetic Governance**
*   **The Theory:** Leadership is the stewardship of system topology.
*   **The Tool:** A **Systemic Dashboard**. Using the GNCA to visualize how "Cognitive Saturation" (information overload) spreads through an organization's communication network, allowing leaders to intervene before the graph loses coherence.

#### **Application C (Economy / INET Oxford): Complexity Economics**
*   **The Theory:** The economy is a non-equilibrium system of interacting automata.
*   **The Model:** Modeling supply chains not as input-output matrices, but as **Evolving Computation**. We track how shocks (Rule 60) propagate through the global trade network, testing which topologies are robust to "Fractal Shattering."
